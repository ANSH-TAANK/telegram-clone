// Debouncing is a programming technique where you delay the execution of a function until a certain amount of time has passed since the last time it was invoked.

// ðŸ‘‰ In simpler terms:
// If something is triggered repeatedly (like typing in a search box), debouncing ensures the function only runs once after the user stops typing for a short period (e.g. 300ms).
// Prevents unnecessary API calls

// Without it, servers get spammed with requests on every keystroke.

// With debouncing, servers only process meaningful requests.

// Reduces load & cost

// Fewer queries = less CPU, memory, and bandwidth usage.

// Important if you pay per request (like with Convex, Firebase, or OpenAI APIs).

// Improves performance for users

// Avoids flickering UI from too many responses.

// Results appear smoother and more stable.

// Scalability

// In large apps, 1000 users typing without debouncing could create tens of thousands of wasted queries per minute.

// Debouncing keeps server demand predictable and manageable.
